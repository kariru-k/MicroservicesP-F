# Platform Service Microservice

This project refers to the creation of two microservices developed as part of a portfolio to show a vivid comprehension of microservice architecture.

The project above demostrates a level of sufficiency in:
* Creating REST APIs in controllers by following MVC pattern as well as the repository pattern
* Creating a Dockerfile needed to deploy the service to Docker
* Creating the requisite Kubernetes resources that enable the deployment of the service onto its own Kubernetes pod as well as exposing a NodePort to allow easy communication among other pods
